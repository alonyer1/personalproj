Each column has a name and a type.
It should be possible to copy rows BY VALUE.
In a select statement, we filter the rows first using the WHERE, and only then we
filter the columns.
An entry (row) has maps of strings and of ints separate.

First, just have to be able to create a table using a string,
to insert, and to print the table.

No, even before the string, we should be able to create and print and add rows.
